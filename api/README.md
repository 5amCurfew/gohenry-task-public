Python API Client

There are three JSON files in this directory which contain response data from an API:
- `campaign_statistics.json`
- `campaigns.json`
- `creatives.json`

To test the client there is a Flask app in `app.py`.
To run the Flask app do the following:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

``
flask run
``

The Flask app should run and does not require an understanding of how Flask apps work. If you would like to use it to test your client and are having issues please raise this with GoHenry.
